## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- Javascript
   Arrays
   Math library
   Random Number Generator
   Loops
   Conditional Statements
   DOM
   Event Listeners
- Laptop-first workflow
- Visual Studio Code


### What I learned

I learnt quite a lot about Javascript while carrying out this task, how to add event listeners, how to target HTMl elements and modify their content using Javascript. I also practicalized the use of arrays, math libraries, and random numbers generator.

```html
<div class="container">
  <div> 
        <h1> Color Flipper </h1>
       <button class="btn"> Click Me </button>
  </div>
  
</div>
```
```css
button {
    background-color: blue;
    border-radius: 5px;
}

```
```js
  const btn= document.querySelector(".btn");
  btn.addEventListener("click", () =>{
      document.body.style.backgroundColor="red";
  });

```
### Continued development

Now I have gotten a good background on HTML and CSS, and Javascript. I would learn more about frameworks like Bootstrap and Jquery
